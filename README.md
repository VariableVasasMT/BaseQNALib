# object-browser

### Introduction

Object browser is an access and retrieval utility for intra-object values.  It 
can work exactly like `lodash`'s `_.get` method and was designed to mimic 
mongodb's ability to access documents nested in an array.  The software was
built to work with `mongo-query-compiler` utility.
